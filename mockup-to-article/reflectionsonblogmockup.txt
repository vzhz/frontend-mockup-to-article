Your response goes here!
I learned how to make a horz. line, citation, and that my text editor will close whatever I have written as a opening tag even if it wasn't a correctly spelled tag!
I don't think any of it has been easy, but there are some parts that I am starting to be able to do without looking them up and that's exciting.
Finding out how to add the horz. line was difficult because I didn't know what is was called at first and didn't know what to search for.
One thing I learned in the first project was proper indentation and that helped a lot this time. I also think the practice looking things up was helpful.
